# Hello-World
My first ever repository. I'm just trying it out and playing around with it. 
Hello Everybody! I'm a 25 year old mother looking to change my career field. I am currently doing massage therapy but would like to transition to android app development. Before I jump into app development I want to learn the fundamentals (you have to crawl before you walk lol). I'm hoping you guys can help me with this and maybe I can show you some cool stuff along the way as well. Look forward to hearing from you guys!
:D
